# Product Requirements Document — TradeTrackr

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2026-04-11
**Status**: Draft

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision

TradeTrackr is a cross-platform trading journal application that enables traders to record, analyze, and improve their trading performance. By providing structured trade logging, visual analytics, and actionable recommendations, TradeTrackr transforms raw trade data into measurable insight.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Traders who rely on memory or scattered spreadsheets lack a systematic way to evaluate their performance. Without structured records, it is difficult to identify recurring mistakes, measure win/loss ratios, or optimize strategies. Existing solutions are often bloated, subscription-heavy, or platform-locked.

### 1.3 Solution

TradeTrackr provides a lightweight, offline-first trading journal that runs on every major platform. Traders log each position manually or via CSV import, then review their performance through an interactive dashboard. A built-in recommendation engine surfaces patterns from historical data to help traders refine their approach.

### 1.4 Target User

A disciplined individual trader who:
- Actively trades financial instruments (indices, forex, crypto, stocks, etc.)
- Records every opened and closed position to maintain a journal
- Wants to measure and improve trading performance over time
- Prefers a self-hosted or privacy-respecting tool over cloud-only SaaS

### 1.5 Language

The application UI, documentation, and all user-facing content for v1 are in **English only**.

| Best Session | Time-of-day session with highest average profit (minimum 5 trades) |
| Avg Win vs Avg Loss | Compare average winning trade vs average losing trade; flag if avg loss > avg win |
| Consecutive Losses | Alert if currently on a streak of 3+ consecutive losses |
| Risk-Reward Alert | Flag if average risk-reward ratio falls below 1:1 |
| Win Rate Trend | Compare win rate of last 10 trades vs overall; flag if declining by >15% |
| Overtrading Alert | Flag if more than X trades are logged in a single day (configurable threshold) |

**Presentation:** Recommendations are displayed as a card list on the dashboard, each with a title, short description, and severity indicator (info, warning, critical).

### 2.8 Dark Theme

| Full Coverage | All screens, charts, and components support both themes |

### 2.9 UI Design Style

The application follows a **clean, minimal, and highly legible** design language inspired by Airbnb's design system. The goal is to present financial data without visual clutter so traders can scan and interpret their performance at a glance.

**Design Principles:**

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Clarity over decoration | Every element serves a purpose. No ornamental graphics, gradients, or visual noise. Data speaks for itself. |
| Generous whitespace | Content breathes. Screens use ample spacing between sections, cards, and data rows. |
| Content-first layout | Numbers, charts, and trade details are the focal point. Chrome and navigation recede. |
| Typographic hierarchy | Clear distinction between headings, body text, labels, and numeric data through size, weight, and color contrast. |

**Visual Tokens:**

| Token | Light Theme | Dark Theme |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Background | `#FFFFFF` | `#121212` |
| Surface / Card | `#F7F7F7` | `#1E1E1E` |
| Primary | `#FF385C` | `#FF385C` |
| Primary Text | `#222222` | `#F5F5F5` |
| Secondary Text | `#717171` | `#A0A0A0` |
| Border / Divider | `#DDDDDD` | `#333333` |
| Success (Profit) | `#008A09` | `#34C759` |
| Danger (Loss) | `#BD1313` | `#FF453A` |

**Typography:**

| Role | Weight | Size |
|------|--------|------|
| Screen Title | Bold | 24px |
| Section Heading | Semi-bold | 18px |
| Card Title / Metric Label | Medium | 16px |
| Body Text | Regular | 14px |
| Caption / Hint | Regular | 12px |
| Numeric Data (Profit, Price) | Semi-bold / Tabular | 16px |

**Component Style:**

| Component | Style |
|-----------|-------|
| Cards | Flat with subtle 1px border, 12px corner radius, no drop shadow |
| Buttons (Primary) | Filled with primary color, 8px corner radius, bold label |
| Buttons (Secondary) | Transparent with 1px border, 8px corner radius |
| Input Fields | Underlined or filled with light surface background, no heavy borders |
| Charts | Flat colors, no 3D effects, consistent with token palette |
| Icons | Outlined style (e.g., Material Symbols — outlined variant) |
| Bottom Navigation | Minimal, icon + label, no background color fill on active tab |
| App Bar | Clean, no elevation, flat background matching screen |

### 3.2 Relationships

- **User → ClosedPosition**: One-to-many. Each closed position belongs to one user.
- **User → OpenPosition**: One-to-many. Each open position belongs to one user.
- **User → FinanceRecord**: One-to-many. Each finance record belongs to one user.
- **OpenPosition → ClosedPosition**: An open position can be converted to a closed position by adding close time, close price, and reason. The original open position is removed and a new closed position is created.
- All queries are scoped to the authenticated user.

### 3.3 Sync Strategy (Offline-First)

| Aspect | Strategy |
|--------|----------|
| Local Store | Drift (SQLite) is the primary data source |
| Remote Store | Supabase PostgreSQL is the secondary/truth source when online |
| Writes | All writes go to Drift first, then sync to Supabase when connectivity is available |
| Reads | Always read from Drift for instant response |
| Conflict Resolution | Last-write-wins based on `updated_at` timestamp |
| Sync Queue | Unsynced records (`is_synced = false`) are pushed to Supabase on connectivity restore |
| Initial Sync | On first login, pull all user's trade data from Supabase into Drift |

---

## 4. Tech Stack

All packages must use the **latest stable versions** as of the project start date.

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| UI Framework | **Flutter** (SDK 3.x, latest stable) | Cross-platform UI toolkit |
| State Management | **Riverpod** (flutter_riverpod) | Reactive state management with code-gen support |
| Routing | **GoRouter** | Declarative routing with deep link support |
| Backend / Auth | **Supabase** (supabase_flutter) | Authentication, remote database, and API |
| Local Database | **Drift** (drift + drift_flutter) | Offline-first SQLite ORM |
| Data Classes | **Freezed** (freezed + freezed_annotation) | Immutable data classes with union types |
| Logging | **Logger** | Structured logging for debugging |
| CSV Parsing | **csv** | Parse and serialize CSV files |
| Charts | **fl_chart** | Rendering dashboard charts and graphs |
| File Picking | **file_picker** | Cross-platform file selection for CSV import |
| DateTime | **intl** | Date formatting and localization utilities |
| UUID | **uuid** | Generate unique trade identifiers |
| Connectivity | **connectivity_plus** | Detect network status for sync logic |
| Path | **path_provider** | Locate filesystem directories for export |
| Sharing | **share_plus** | Share exported CSV files (mobile) |

### Code Generation

The project uses build_runner for code generation:
- `freezed` — generates immutable data classes, copyWith, equality
- `drift` — generates database code
- `riverpod_generator` — generates providers (optional, if using code-gen Riverpod)

### Documentation Reference Rule

**MCP Context7 is the primary and mandatory reference** for all tech stack documentation during development. Before using any API, package, or framework pattern, developers must consult Context7 to ensure accuracy with the latest versions.

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Primary Source | Always query MCP Context7 first when looking up documentation for any package or framework listed in the tech stack |
| Coverage | Applies to all technologies: Flutter, Riverpod, GoRouter, Supabase, Drift, Freezed, and all supporting packages |
| Purpose | Ensures code uses current APIs and avoids deprecated patterns from outdated training data |
| When to Use | Before writing any implementation involving a package API, configuration, migration guide, or setup pattern |
| Workflow | Resolve the library ID via Context7, then query the specific documentation needed — do not rely on memory or assumed knowledge |

---

## 5. Architecture

### 5.1 Clean Architecture — Layer-First Structure

The project follows **Clean Architecture** with a **layer-first** directory organization. Top-level directories represent architectural layers; features are organized as files within each layer. This ensures strict dependency enforcement at the folder level and makes the layer boundaries immediately visible.

### 5.2 Layer Rules

| Layer | Depends On | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Presentation** | Domain | UI, widgets, Riverpod providers. No direct data layer access. |
| **Domain** | Nothing | Pure Dart: entities, repository interfaces, use cases. No framework imports. |
| **Data** | Domain | Repository implementations, data sources, DTOs. Implements domain interfaces. |

Dependency direction: **Presentation → Domain ← Data**. The domain layer has zero external dependencies.

### 5.3 SOLID Principles (Strict Enforcement)

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **S** — Single Responsibility | Each class has exactly one reason to change. Use cases encapsulate single actions. Widgets are decomposed into small, focused components. |
| **O** — Open/Closed | Entities and use cases are extended via new implementations, not modified. Repository interfaces allow swapping data sources without touching domain logic. |
| **L** — Liskov Substitution | All repository implementations are fully substitutable for their interfaces. Mock repositories pass the same contract tests as real ones. |
| **I** — Interface Segregation | Repository interfaces are split per feature (e.g., `TradeQueryRepository`, `TradeCommandRepository`) rather than one monolithic `TradeRepository`. |
| **D** — Dependency Inversion | Domain defines repository interfaces; data layer provides implementations. Use cases receive repository interfaces via constructor injection, not concrete classes. |

### 5.4 Repository Segregation Pattern

Repositories are split by **operation type**, not by entity. This ensures each use case depends only on the operations it needs. Interface definitions live in `domain/repositories/`; implementations live in `data/repositories/`.

**Interfaces** (`domain/repositories/`):

```
domain/repositories/
├── trade_query_repository.dart        # Read operations (getTrades, getTradeById, getAnalytics)
├── trade_command_repository.dart      # Write operations (addTrade, updateTrade, deleteTrade)
├── trade_import_repository.dart       # Bulk import operations (importFromCsv)
├── trade_export_repository.dart       # Export operations (exportToCsv)
├── auth_repository.dart               # Authentication operations
└── user_profile_repository.dart       # User profile CRUD
```

**Implementations** (`data/repositories/`):

```
data/repositories/
├── trade_query_repository_impl.dart
├── trade_command_repository_impl.dart
├── trade_import_repository_impl.dart
├── trade_export_repository_impl.dart
├── auth_repository_impl.dart
└── user_profile_repository_impl.dart
```

Each use case injects only the repository interface it requires:

```
GetTradeAnalyticsUseCase → depends on TradeQueryRepository (domain interface)
AddTradeUseCase → depends on TradeCommandRepository (domain interface)
ImportTradesUseCase → depends on TradeImportRepository (domain interface)
```

### 5.5 Offline-First Strategy

```

1. **All writes** go to Drift (local SQLite) immediately.
2. A background sync engine monitors connectivity and pushes unsynced records to Supabase.
3. **All reads** come from Drift for instant, offline-capable responses.
4. On login, a full pull from Supabase seeds the local database.
5. Sync status is surfaced in the UI (synced / pending / offline).

## 6. Platform Support

| Platform | Minimum Version | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Android | API 21+ (Android 5.0) | Primary target |
| iOS | 12.0+ | Primary target |
| macOS | 10.14+ (Mojave) | Supported |
| Windows | Windows 10+ | Supported |
| Linux | Any modern distro | Supported |
| Web | Latest Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari | Supported (no Drift — Supabase-only fallback) |

**Web caveat:** Drift supports Web via `sql.js` or `wa` (WASM). If full offline is required on Web, use Drift's Web support; otherwise, fall back to Supabase-only mode.

| Multi-language / i18n | v1 is English only |
| Social features (sharing, following) | Not core to journaling |
| Broker API integration / auto-import | Requires per-broker integration work |
| Strategy backtesting | Complex feature, deferred |
| Multi-account support | Adds data model complexity |
| Tags / custom labels on trades | Can be added in minor release |
| Chart annotations and notes | Deferred to v2 |
| Local database encryption | Deferred to v2 |
| Push notifications for sync status | Deferred to v2 |
| Widget support (Android/iOS home screen) | Deferred to v2 |
